WaterBuddy App
WaterBuddy is a lightweight hydration-tracking app built with Python and Streamlit. It’s designed to make staying hydrated easy by giving users an age-appropriate daily water goal and updating their progress in real time as they log their intake. As you add water, the app shows how much you’ve consumed, how much is left to reach your goal, and how close you are in percentage. A progress bar fills up as you drink more, and friendly, motivational messages appear along the way to keep you going.


WaterBuddy aims to be simple, helpful, and enjoyable, guiding users toward better daily hydration habits through a clean interface and real-time feedback. If you're looking for an easy way to track your water intake, this app keeps things straightforward and friendly.
